# OpenBCI to EDF (Matlab/Octave)

# Introduction
OpenBCI is an open source brain-computer interface platform used to record electrical activity produced by the brain (EEG), the muscles (EMG) or the heart (EKG), among others. When using the OpenBCI platform one might be interested in exporting the results to EDF(+). Motivation includes easy sharing of the results  with the community, using an open standard format, or the possibility to use any of the many existing tools to, for example, visualize the results, or to apply additional signal processing to the data.  Check more about EDF(+) format at www.edfplus.info. 

On this page a Matlab/Octave script is offered to carry out the conversion from the OpenBCI format (as resulted from logging the results to a SD card) to EDF. A mini-tutorial is also available on how to use the code and visualize the resulting signal data in Polyman.
